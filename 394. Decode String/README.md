#394. Decode String

v1:

Assign a pointer i to traverse the string s. When i meets a number, find the following bracket pair (which may contain other bracket pairs) and call the function recursively.

v2:

Match the inner bracket pairs with regular expression, replace them with decoded string. Repeat it until no bracket in the string.

I don't know why v2 is faster...
